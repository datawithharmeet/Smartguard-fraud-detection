# SmartGuard: Real-Time Transaction Fraud Detection System

**SmartGuard** is a production-ready fraud detection system designed to score financial transactions in real-time. The project combines data engineering, supervised machine learning, threshold optimization, SHAP-based explainability, and cloud deployment components, making it a scalable, business-impact-driven solution. Trained on 9 million labeled transactions and supported by 4 million unlabeled transactions for streaming simulation, SmartGuard mimics enterprise-grade fraud detection pipelines used in the financial sector.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

* ✅ End-to-end pipeline covering data ingestion, transformation, model training, tuning, validation, and deployment
* 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis and statistical testing to validate data assumptions and shape transformation strategy
* ⚙️ Feature engineering pipeline using YAML config, including log transforms, ratios, encodings, and business rules
* 🧠 Trained multiple models (XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest) with recall-prioritized threshold tuning
* 🎯 Final model achieved **82% recall** and **3.8% precision** at 0.8 threshold — balancing fraud catch rate with customer experience
* 🔍 SHAP explainability integrated for both global summaries and local transaction-level force plots
* 🌐 Real-time risk scoring API deployed using FastAPI and models stored on AWS S3
* 🔄 **Kafka-based streaming (in progress)** for simulating real-time transaction ingestion and scoring
